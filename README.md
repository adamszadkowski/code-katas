# Code Katas

## Binary Tree Parser Kata

Figure out a ASCII format for binary tree and implement parser for it.
Consider keeping some additional data in tree node than just left/right reference.
In next step make parser more generic to support different nodes.

## Binary Tree Printer Kata

Implement a functionality which will convert a binary tree into ASCII format. Present
node data and consider in which class/entity this responsibility should be implemented.

This kata is a supplement for [Binary Tree Parser Kata](#binary-tree-parser-kata).
Consider using the same ASCII format for both katas.
